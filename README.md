# RiverRaid-Pygame

RiverRaid-Pygame is a classic, 2D shooter game inspired by the original River Raid. This version of the game is written in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Features

- **Exciting Gameplay:** Navigate your ship through dangerous waters while shooting down enemy vessels. But be careful! Colliding with an enemy or the riverbanks will result in a game over.
- **Fuel Management:** Keep an eye on your fuel gauge! If you run out of fuel, it's game over. Pick up fuel tanks to refill your gauge and keep going.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points for shooting down enemy vessels. Try to beat your high score!

## Project Structure

The project is divided into multiple Python files:

- `main.py`: This is the main game script where the game loop and primary game mechanics are handled.
- `game_state.py`: This file handles the game state, including the player's fuel and score.
- `game_objects.py`: This file contains various game objects, like the player, enemies, and fuel.
- `mapeditor.py`: This script allows you to create and edit custom levels for the game.

## Getting Started

To run the game, first ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py

## Contributing

We are actively seeking contributors to help improve RiverRaid-Pygame. Here are a few areas where we could use some help:

- **Sound Effects:** We are currently looking for help implementing sound effects into the game. If you have experience with Pygame's sound libraries, we'd love to hear from you.
- **Map Editor Improvements:** Our map editor is functional, but could use some improvements. Specifically, the copy and paste functionality for game objects could use some refining.
- **Additional Enemies:** We currently have some enemies implemented, but are looking to add more diversity. In particular, we have not yet implemented the airplane enemy.

If you are interested in contributing to any of these areas, or have other improvements in mind, please feel free to make a pull request or open an issue to discuss your ideas.
